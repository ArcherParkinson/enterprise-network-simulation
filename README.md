# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Lab

This lab simulates a basic enterprise network using:
- OSPF routing between two routers
- DHCP server for dynamic IP assignment
- DNS server to resolve domain names to IP addresses
- NAT Overload (PAT) to allow internal devices to access the internet using a single public IP address

**Created using Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x**
